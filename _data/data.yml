        I am currently working towards the end of my PhD thesis. The topic of my work is the design and implementation of algorithms that rely on chemical and genomic data integration to create new drug-target hypotheses in pathogens causing a wide range of neglected diseases. We do this by creating complex, multilayer networks that connect similar entities (i.e drug-drug, target-target) through the means of physicochemical properties and functional/phylogenetic affiliations, respectively; and connecting drugs to targets using existing bioactivity data. Finally, new connections are projected between drugs and targets using the latter as starting points, creating novel putative interactions between them. We then manually curate these interactions and test trypanocide activity against *Trypanosoma cruzi* in phenotypic assays, or possible inhibition on recombinant purified enzymes in biochemical assays.

        Co-Founder of a Data Science company, focused on bringing the scientific mindset to business decision making and the development of data-driven products. My role in the company could fit into the job description of a Full Stack Developer, bringing statistical models and business intelligence dashboards to life in the form of APIs or web-based applications. I also learned a thing or two of graphic design and interface development. Though I will not be taking on any new projects, I am still part of the team as an advisor.

        As a TA for a renowned course such as the Working with Pathogen Genomes Course from the Wellcome Trust Overseas Programme, I helped students with technical difficulties during practical assignments and sometimes with the language barriers they could find when learning in a foreign language. This experience, though fairly short-lived, greatly boosted the confidence I had in my English proficiency.

        abstract : The 2nd Argentine Symposium of Young Bioinformatics Researchers (2SAJIB according to its acronym in Spanish) took place on November 2017 in Buenos Aires Argentina. SAJIB is the main annual student-based activity in the field of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology in Argentina and one of the largest in Latin America. Here we summarize the main activities and outcomes from the 2nd SAJIB that gathered together young students and researchers from all over the country and featured recognized Principal Investigators both from the local and international scenes.
